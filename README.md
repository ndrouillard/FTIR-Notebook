# FTIR Notebook
This repository is essentially just one big notebook for my code, for backup purposes. When the project is complete, I will organize this properly and include
documenation to go along with it. This code is intended for doing Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Some of the code is meant to be run on a RaspberryPi 4, and some of it is meant for PC. ADCs include the BitScope Micro, Labjack T7-Pro, and Arduino. The moving mirror is controlled using a Micronix motor stage.
