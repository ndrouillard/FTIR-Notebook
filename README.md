# Portable-FTIR
This is a Tkinter GUI intended for doing Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) on a RaspberryPi 4 using a BitScope Micro as the ADC, and a Micronix motor stage. 
This repository is essentially just one big notebook for my code, for backup purposes. When the project is complete, I will organize this properly in one repository and include
documenation to go along with it.
